Hi! I'm Amanda!

##### Now for the fun, often nerdy, stuff

* Reading - For business books, I always recommend people read [Drop the Pink Elephant](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/606239.Drop_the_Pink_Elephant) by Bill McFarlan and [Culture Map](https://erinmeyer.com/books/the-culture-map/) by Erin Meyer. 
For fiction, I nearly always one or two (or five) books in progress at any one time thanks to the local library! My most recent read was [The Guest List](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51933429-the-guest-list) by Lisa Foley (perfect for fans of Agatha Christie).

* Board games - My favorites include [Seasons](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108745/seasons) and [7 Wonders](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders).

* Cooking - I ususally like to cook things that remind me of growing up, so mostly Italian food. But, I love to experiment with new recipes!

* Crafting - Everything and anything. I've been a knitter and crocheter for 15 years and yarn work will always be a passion. Do you have a ravelry account? Feel free to look at my [past projects](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/aquaranto/).

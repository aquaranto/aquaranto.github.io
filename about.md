Hi! I'm Amanda!

#####Would you like to HIREME? Let's talk!

#####Now for the fun, often nerdy, stuff
* Board games - My favorites include [Seasons](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108745/seasons) and [7 Wonders](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders).

* Cooking - I ususally like to cook things that remind me of growing up, so mostly Italian food. But, I love to experiment with new recipes!

* Crafting - Everything and anything. I've been a knitter and crocheter for 15 years and yarn work will always be a passion. Do you have a ravelry account? Feel free to look at my [past projects](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/aquaranto/).

* Reading - For business books, one that I always recommend is [Farm don't Hunt](http://farmdonthunt.com/) by Guy Nirpaz. For fiction, I'm slowly working my way through the unabridged version of [The Stand](https://www.audible.com/pd/Fiction/The-Stand-Audiobook/B0077DEH7A) by Stephen King - which adds up to a 48 HOUR audio book.

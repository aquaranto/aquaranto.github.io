Hi! I'm Amanda!

![Me](https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t31.0-8/10285142_10100871048204455_9142044647718762879_o.jpg)

#####Now for the fun, often nerdy, stuff
* Board games - My favorites include [Seasons](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108745/seasons) and [7 Wonders](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/68448/7-wonders).

* Cooking - I am currently leveling up my chef skills with the help of [Blue Apron](http://blueapron.com).

* Crafting - Everything and anything. I've been a knitter and crocheter for 15 years and yarn work will always be a passion. Do you have a ravelry account? Feel free to look at my [past projects](http://www.ravelry.com/projects/aquaranto/).

* Reading - I always recommend “Ready Player One” by Ernest Cline. A very good read that is made for every nerd.

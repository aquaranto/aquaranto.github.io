Hi there! I am Amanda Quaranto: a Manufacturing Engineer turned Application Support Engineer.

![Hey!](http://howstuffworks.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/panda4.jpg)

###Before we begin...

I thought I'd try my hand at integrating the Stripe checkout form for myself. Feel free to try the result using the following test card number:

	4242 4242 4242 4242


<br /><form action="http://young-ravine-2763.herokuapp.com/charge" method="post" style="text-align:center">
    <script
        src="https://checkout.stripe.com/checkout.js" class="stripe-button"
        data-key="pk_test_REiRXJkBrkRnp8Nn7YdHN7cb" 
        data-amount="0099"
        data-name="HIREMEv2.0"
        data-description="Blog Post : $0.99"
        data-image="https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpf1/t31.0-8/10285142_10100871048204455_9142044647718762879_o.jpg"
        data-allow-remember-me="false">
      </script>
</form>	
<br />

 Everything about the integration was very positive. In order to embed the checkout form I only needed to use two docs [https://stripe.com/docs/checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout) and [https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/guides/sinatra](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout/guides/sinatra). Because I was using Jekyll and Github Pages for this post, I needed a small sinatra backend to deal with the POST. I was pleasantly surprised how well written and easy to follow the guides were. The only thing I would add is a short comment about git as it is a requirement for heroku. Overall, it was a really great experience! Now, onto what you came here for:

###Background
In November 2011, I left my manufacturing engineering position in Boston, MA and I found myself with an amazing, albeit daunting, opportunity to find my passion. My husband and I moved closer to family and I started on my quest to find a career that encompasses everything I love:

* deductive reasoning
* problem solving
* building professional relationships
* teaching and getting others interested and involved  
* time and project management

After several months of teaching myself to program, I started work as a junior developer. I appreciated how it utilized many of the things I enjoy including problem solving and constant learning. But, I found that I was still missing the part of my previous career that I loved most, working with and helping other people. I found my passion in Application Engineering and Support.

###Relevant Work experience

* Deployment Engineer/ PANDA at Engine Yard remotely from Buffalo, NY June 2013 - present
* Jr. Rails Developer at Academic Software Plus in Buffalo, NY Jan 2013 to June 2013
* Intern at Academic Software Plus in Buffalo, NY Oct 2012 to Jan 2013

###Current participation in the developer community

* Lead organizer for NickelCityRuby '13,'14
* WNYRuby and OpenHack Meetups
* Attending Conferences - RailsConf '12,'13,'14, SteelCityRuby '12,'14, Codemash '12,13, MagicRuby '12

###So, why am I a good fit?
####I am...

* **a problem solver**

As a manufacturing engineer one of my primary functions was "problem solver". This included customer/supplier issues, design problems, and machine programming and maintenance.

This was further improved while working as a deployment engineer. I spend most of my workday helping new customers get comfortable with the platform. This was done over live chat as well as through skype and email.

* **personable**

At Engine Yard, I spend much of my time speaking with customers. I always do my very best to make sure customers have everything they need to be successful. 

* **a creator** 

Since entering the tech world I have been amazed by the ease at which things are created. Entire website can come togehter in minutes (with years of tweaking afterwards). It's primarily what drew me to programming. 

I've been a creator most of my life. I have knitted and crocheted for 15 years. I love the feeling of accomplishment associated with the creation of something tangible. (And, yarn projects are the perfect thing to keep warm during Buffalo winters).

* **a teacher**

While in my second year of college I started a student chapter of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers(SME).  The group worked on many projects which included programming the hotdog robot [Version 1:Tabletop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enmuwG5rOGA), [Version 2: Mobile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LXdhUK-wXk). This project was shown at the ImagineRIT festival in Rochester, NY with the hope of getting children interested in engineering.

Also while in college, I was a member of Women in Technology (WIT). Several times a year we invited local girl scouts to RIT to learn about different engineering disciplines. I led the activities for mechanical engineering and material science.

I also organize the local [knit and crochet](www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Knit-and-Crochet) group in Buffalo. While we meet weekly, once a month we have a dedicated Learning Night where we teach new members the craft.

* **a student**

Being a good student is a difficult skill to master. I make a point to always be learning. 

While teaching myself to program I took many online courses including ones from [CodeSchool](https://www.codeschool.com/) and [Team Tree House](http://teamtreehouse.com/). I also enjoy humanities and computer science courses offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [Edx](https://www.edx.org/).

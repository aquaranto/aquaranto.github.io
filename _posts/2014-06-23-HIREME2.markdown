Hi there! I am Amanda Quaranto: a Manufacturing Engineer turned Application Support Engineer.

![Hey!](http://howstuffworks.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/panda4.jpg)


###Background
In November 2011, I left my manufacturing engineering position in Boston, MA and I found myself with an amazing, albeit daunting, opportunity to find my passion. My husband and I moved closer to family and I started on my quest to find a career that encompasses everything I love:

* deductive reasoning
* problem solving
* building professional relationships
* teaching and getting others interested and involved  
* time and project management

After several months of teaching myself to program, I started work as a junior developer. I appreciated how it utilized many of the things I enjoy including problem solving and constant learning. But, I found that I was still missing the part of my previous career that I loved most, working with and helping other people.

###So, why am I a good fit?
####I am...

* **a problem solver**

As a manufacturing engineer one of my primary functions was "problem solver". This included customer/supplier issues, design problems, and machine programming and maintenance.

This was further improved while working as a deployment engineer. I spent most of my workday helping new customers get comfortable with the platform. This was done over live chat as well as through skype and email communication.

* **personable**

In my final year at RIT, I worked on a capstone project with my entire senior class (11 people). I was selected to be the voice of my capstone group. I presented both our midterm and final presentations to faculty, including the head of the department.

At Engine Yard, I spend much of my time speaking with customers. I always do my very best to make sure the customer has everything they need to be successful.

* **a creator** 

I have been spending 

I have been a knitter and crocheter for 15 years. I love the feeling of accomplishment associated with the creation of something tangible. (And, yarn projects are the perfect thing to keep warm during Buffalo winters).

* **a teacher**

While in my second year of college I started a student chapter of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers(SME).  The group worked on many projects which included programming the hotdog robot [Version 1:Tabletop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enmuwG5rOGA), [Version 2: Mobile](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LXdhUK-wXk). This project was shown at the ImagineRIT festival in Rochester, NY with the hope of getting children interested in engineering.

Also while in college, I was a member of Women in Technology (WIT). Several times a year we invited local girl scouts to RIT to learn about different engineering disciplines. I led the activities for mechanical engineering and material science.

I also organize the local [knit and crochet](www.meetup.com/Buffalo-Knit-and-Crochet) group in Buffalo. Once a month we have a dedicated Learning Night were we teach new members the craft.

* **a student**

I find that I am constantly learning. I always try to surround myself with intellegent people
